## Content Management

### Updating existing content


When updating existing content it is highly recommended to use the "Replace content" feature instead of using the [Page Builder](#page-builder)

How to use:

Under content you will have 2 options "Metaobjects" and "Files"

Select "Files"

Verify that you have selected the right file and rename the file if appropriate

Click on the file you would like to replace then navigate to the "Replace" button as shown in the screenshot.

Then you can select the file you would like to upload, after it successfully loads you can hit Save and you are good to go.
